# SmartLearn Color Usage Guide

## Design Philosophy
SmartLearn follows a **minimalist design approach** with strategic color accents. The interface is primarily neutral (whites, grays, black) with colors used sparingly for visual hierarchy and wayfinding.

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors (Minimal Usage)
- **Strong Cyan** `#2ac8d2` - Students, primary actions, login accent
- **Tan** `#c5a988` - Teachers, subject indicators
- **Air Force Blue** `#6292b1` - Classes, timetable features
- **Tangerine Dream** `#fea37b` - Attendance, alerts, highlights
- **Steel Blue** `#4981a5` - Schedule entries, supporting elements

### Neutral Colors (Dominant)
- **Gray 900** `#1a1a1a` - Primary text, active navigation
- **Gray 700** - Secondary text
- **Gray 500** - Tertiary text, placeholders
- **Gray 200/300** - Borders
